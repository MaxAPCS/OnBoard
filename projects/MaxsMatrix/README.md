# 8x8 Charlieplexed LED Matrix

A small board containing 64 LEDs, Charlieplexed to work with 9 pins.
Powered by the Maxim Integrated MAX6951 IC.
To be controlled via a microcontroller (Arduino) over SPI.

Ten boards are being ordered, plus shipping, at a cost of $90.39.

I used a lot of references, and reread the datasheets a lot. Here's to hoping it works!
