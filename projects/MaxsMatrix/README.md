# 8x8 Charlieplexed LED Matrix

A small board containing 64 LEDs, Charlieplexed to work with 9 pins.
Powered by the Maxim Integrated MAX6951 IC.
To be controlled via a microcontroller (Arduino) over SPI.

Ten boards are being ordered, plus shipping, at a cost of $80.39 (coupon included). Parts that need to be pre-ordered cost an additional $30.84 for a total cost of $111.23. I would need to cover the extra cost.

I used a lot of references, and reread the datasheets a lot. Here's to hoping it works!
